## A new way to publish digital editions


-   a transparent and collaborative review process
-   rigorous technical requirements allowing replicable validation of structure and contents of editions
-   data sets maintained in a public github archive (<https://github.com/hc-dde/editions>)
-   simple data formats easily re-used in many technical environments


## Coming in 2018

-   publication series through the College of the Holy Cross' [Cross Works](http://crossworks.holycross.edu/peer_review_list.html) institutional repository
